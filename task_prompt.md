# Business Performance Analytics â€“ Real-World Data Exploration in Power BI

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in our Data Analyst position. This take-home assessment is designed to evaluate your analytical skills, data visualization capabilities, and business acumen using Power BI.

## Scenario

You've just joined GlobalTech Solutions, a mid-size company with operations across North America, Europe, and Asia. As the new Data Analyst, you've been handed a dataset exported from their legacy systems containing information about sales, products, customers, inventory, suppliers, and marketing campaigns.

There is no data dictionary provided, as this reflects a common real-world scenario where analysts must work with unfamiliar data. Your task is to explore, clean, model, and extract meaningful insights using Power BI to help the executive team make informed business decisions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of multiple interconnected tables exported from various business systems:

- Sales transactions
- Product information
- Customer details
- Inventory records
- Supplier data
- Marketing campaigns
- Discount promotions
- Product returns

The data spans the last two years and contains some inconsistencies, missing values, and non-obvious column names that you'll need to interpret based on context.

## Assignment Instructions

### 1. Load & Connect the Data

- Import all CSV files into Power BI
- Establish appropriate relationships between tables
- Use Power Query Editor to clean and transform the data as needed

### 2. Data Modeling

Create the following DAX measures (at minimum):

- Revenue (total and by various dimensions)
- Gross margin
- Units sold
- Return rate
- Average order value
- Customer segmentation (by spend, frequency, or other metrics you deem relevant)
- Year-over-year growth metrics

### 3. Dashboards & Visuals

Build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with the following components:

### 4. Business Insights & Recommendations

Include these recommendations in a text box within your Power BI report or as a separate one-page PDF document.
